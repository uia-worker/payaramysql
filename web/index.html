    <h1>Using DatabaseRealm in the Rolodex WebApp</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Open Web Pages/META-INF/context.xml (or configuration files/context.xml
        (it's the same file). Change the Resource definition to match your
        database (The file is write protected. You should enable writing first).
        You should also check the Realm definition. The things you can set is 
        mostly self-explanatory (table and column names).</li>
      <li>The SQL scripts will create tables that suits the
        original author (probably me  ;-)<br/>
        Read the file at least a couple of times, to learn what information
        you need to set up the database. Then edit the script to suit your 
        requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run the sql script(s) to create the database tables. Restart tomcat.
        When tomcat has started again, you can run this application to verify
        that it works, but you should really take a close look at web.xml
        before you do. Read the file carefully, with a little effort you will
        understand how it works.
      </li>
      <li>Checklist:
         <ul>
       <li>Checking means testing, that is it runs <strong>and produces the correct result</strong>.
        If you can't test, at least double check spelling of everything that
        refers to something else (at both ends) and remember: <strong>upper-/lower-case matter!</strong></li>
          <li>
          The Datasource is defined in context.xml. Is it correctly configured
          (you have tested that it works)
        </li>
        <li>The realm is correctly configured in context.xml. 
          The reference to the DataSource is correct. The table and column
          names are correct</li>
        <li>The servlet url patterns in the url-pattern tags in web.xml are correct</li>
        <li>The role names in web.xml are correct</li>
        <li>You are using the usernames and passwords from the database</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
